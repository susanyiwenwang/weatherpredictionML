# Predicting Weather with Machine Learning Models
Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project on Weather Prediction

## Project Background
ClimateWins, a European nonprofit organization, is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. <br/>

As a data analyst for ClimateWins, I will assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. 
ClimateWins believes that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.

## Data set
The data is sourced from the [European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.](https://www.ecad.eu/)<br/>
It contains data from 18 European weather stations ranging from the late 1800's to 2022. Weather variables include temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, global radiation and more.

## Key hyotheses
- Machine Learning can be applied to the data to predict weather conditions.
- Certain models perform better than others in predicting weather.
- Extreme weather events have been increasing over the last few decades.
  
## Optimization and Preparation
- Gradient Descent algorithm run on mean temperatures in various weather stations.
- Data scaled and split into training/ test sets.
  
## Machine Learning Algorithms
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- ANN
